demo [ <option> ... ] <key-file> <cipher-file>
  
  * You must always supply the input files (key and ciphertext) to this executable.
  * The <key-file> is ignored in --crack-cipher and --strat-etai modes, a blank key
    is used instead.
  * The <cipher-file> is ignored in --secret-word-enum.
  
 where <option> is one of
/ -e, --strat-etai : List substitutions computed by strategy etai on <cipher-file> on a blank key
| -d, --dict-closure : Extend partial key in <key-file> using ciphertext from <input-file> using dictionary closure
| -s, --secret-word-enum : Perform secret word enumeration using partial key in <key-file>
\ -c, --crack-cipher : Crack cipher using a blank key and ciphertext from <cipher-file>
 

  --help, -h : Show this help
  -- : Do not treat any remaining argument as a switch (at this level)
 /|\ Brackets indicate mutually exclusive options.
 Multiple single-letter switches can be combined after one `-'; for
  example: `-h-' is the same as `-h --'
